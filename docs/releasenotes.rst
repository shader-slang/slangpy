Release Notes
=============

**Version 0.21.0**

This version added full support for Jupyter notebooks, including better printing of Python values and visualization of textures in Jupyter. Additionally, structs can now be directly returned from scalar calls, and hash/rand generators are much more robust.

**Version 0.20.0**

The main change in this release was to address the confusion over how a Slang vector type is interpreted when used to represent coordinates
in the call id grid, or as indices into a buffer. To map naturally to images and the Texture.Load function in Slang, the vector coordinates 
are treated as the **transpose** of their corresponding coordinates when specified as an array. This means that for a given call id [A,B,C],
a corresponding vector representation would be int3(C,B,A).  

**Version 0.19.5**

Past releases since 0.17 have focussed on extensive bug fixes, documentation and optimizations. This release includes 
documentation for and examples of the generators system in SlangPy. 

**Version 0.17.0**

This release includes a major update to the `nv-sgl` library, which now includes CoopVec support, alongside more significant optimizations 
for buffers, textures and tensors. Planned imminent API changes to the 'from_numpy' functions on tensors/buffers.

**Version 0.15.0**

Recent changes have added extensive optimizations through native extension to the dispatch process, and fully functional PyTorch autograd support.
